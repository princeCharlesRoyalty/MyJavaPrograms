_Cats and a Mouse_

Two cats named _A_ and _B_ are standing at integral points on the x-axis. Cat _A_ is standing at point _x_ and cat _B_ is standing at point _y_. Both cats run at the same speed, and they want to catch a mouse named _C_ that's hiding at integral point _z_ on the x-axis. Can you determine who will catch the mouse?

You are given _q_ queries in the form of _x, y, and z._ For each query, print the appropriate answer on a new line:

*•* If cat _A_ catches the mouse first, print ```Cat A```.
*•* If cat _B_ catches the mouse first, print ```Cat B```.
*•* If both cats reach the mouse at the same time, print ```Mouse C``` as the two cats fight and mouse escapes.

*Input Format*

The first line contains a single integer, _q_, denoting the number of queries. 
Each of the _q_ subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective values of _x_ (cat 's location), _y_ (cat 's location), and _z_ (mouse 's location).

*Constraints*

1 <= _q_ <= 100
1 <= _x, y, z_ <= 100

*Output Format*

On a new line for each query, print ```Cat A``` if cat catches the mouse first, ```Cat B``` if cat catches the mouse first, or ```Mouse C``` if the mouse escapes.

*Sample Input 0*
