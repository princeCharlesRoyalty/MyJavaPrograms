_Java Anagram_

Two strings  _A_ and  _B_ are called anagrams if they consist same characters, but may be in different orders. So the list of anagrams of _CAT_  is  _CAT, ACT, TAC, TCA , ATC, CTA_.

Given two strings, print ```Anagrams``` if they are anagrams, print ```Not Anagrams``` if they are not. The strings may consist at most  _50_ English characters; the comparison should NOT be case sensitive.

This exercise will verify that you can sort the characters of a string, or compare frequencies of characters.

*Sample Input 0*
```
anagram margana ```

*Sample Output 0*
```
Anagrams ```

*Sample Input 1*
```
anagramm marganaa ```

*Sample Output 1:*
```
Not Anagrams```


*Explanation*
Order the characters in _anagram_ and you have _aaagmnr_

Order the characters in _margana_ and you have _aaagmnr_

Then compare. 

And since they are the same, you print ```ANAGRAM```.
